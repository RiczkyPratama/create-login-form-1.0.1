# create-login-form-1.0.1
This repository was created by Riczky Pratama which contains instructions on how to create a simple login form. I am attaching a program in java and a readme which contains a detailed explanation of the coding.

Explanation of the coding file "Login_Application.java" is here and is divided into two languages, English and Indonesian. If you want to see the Indonesian language. Scroll and see the readme at the bottom. Thank You.
